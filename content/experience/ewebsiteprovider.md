### Description

- As a web development intern, I am responsible for designing and developing web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I work with front-end frameworks like React and Vue, and I use back-end technologies like Node.js and MongoDB to build scalable and dynamic web applications. Additionally, I work on WordPress sites, customizing themes and building custom plugins to meet client needs.
In addition to these, I am gaining experience with agile development methodologies, version control using Git, project management tools like Bitrix24, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), including EC2, S3, and Lambda. My ongoing internship is providing me with valuable experience and skills that will be relevant to my future career as a developer.
